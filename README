! On Monday 27th of June 2011, Kik 5.1 was released. One of the changes was to !
! perform certificate verification on the SSL connection. So it is no longer   !
! possible to MITM Kik. This change breaks KikSig.pl, and is a good thing.     !
!                                                                              !
! Even though this code no longer works (and can't be made to), I will leave   !
! it online as a learning aid to others.                                       !
!                                                                              !
